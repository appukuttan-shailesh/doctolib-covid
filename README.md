## Update (Shailesh Appukuttan)

Email notifications were found to be too slow to be effective (as the slots were found to be booked very quickly)
So the script has been updated to do the following:

1. checks multiple centers in parallel, thereby speeding up search
   - set number of cores
2. sounds an alarm for each available center with slots
3. auto opens the doctolib page for the center when slots are found

### Usage:

- Set the vaccination centers close to your location in [centers.txt](../master/centers.txt)

- Execute command
  `$ python doctolib-covid_multiprocess.py`

(unchanged docs from source repo below)

## Doctolib COVID

This script sends email alerts (using Google SMTP server) when vaccination appointments are available on Doctolib.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3

## Download dependencies

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Execution

- Set the vaccination centers close to your location in [centers.txt](../master/centers.txt)

- Set environment variables

  - DISABLE_EMAIL: set to true to disable email alerts
  - SENDER_EMAIL: the sender email address
  - SENDER_PASSWORD: the associated password
  - RECEIVER_EMAIL : the receiver email address

- Execute command
  `$ python doctolib-covid.py`

- Output example

## Cron

Use [cron-doctolib-covid.yml](../master/.github/workflows/cron-doctolib-covid.yml) to schedule the script execution. Uncomment the `schedule` section.
The example below executes the script every 5 minutes

```yaml
name: Cron Doctolib COVID

on:
  [...]
  schedule:
    - cron: "*/5 * * * *"

[...]
```
